<p> Introduction </p> Ameloblastomas are odontogenic tumors. Ameloblastoma appearance is about 1% of all jaw tumors, however, this malignant become the second-most common odontogenic tumor. The overall recurrence rate of ameloblastoma is approximately 10% which is relatively high for benign tumors. This cohort retrospective study want to explore the recurrence factors of Ameloblastoma based on patient medical records.
<p> <b>Results</b>: From all 97 patients of outpatients ameloblastoma, we divided into training and testing data set (80%:20%). We built the models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) in the training model, then predicted the accuracy of models with testing data set. We found the Decision Tree model showed the highest accuracy of model (93.7%). We also developed a mini-app with the shinyapp (https://7hb5lh-dhihram-tenrisau.shinyapps.io/app_ml/)
